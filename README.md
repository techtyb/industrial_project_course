The task problem is to process the raw signal data from the Marginum's device signal. The data is not pre processed and is very noisy. We have to pre process it using some previous existing algorithm. We need to do Data cleaning, Data transformation and Data reduction. We also need it to plot, detect peaks for the tumor signals and generate relative outputs.
